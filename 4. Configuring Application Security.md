### Configuring Application Security

Creating a Secret
Create a generic secret containing key-value pairs from literal values typed on the command line:
```
oc create secret generic secret_name --from-literal key1=secret1 --from-literal key2=secret2
```
Create a generic secret using key names specified on the command line and values from files:
```
oc create secret generic ssh-keys --from-file id_rsa=/path-to/id_rsa --from-file id_rsa.pub=/path-to/id_rsa.pub
```
Create a TLS secret specifying a certificate and the associated key:
```
oc create secret tls secret-tls --cert /path-to-certificate --key /path-to-key
```

Exposing Secrets to Pods
```
oc create secret generic demo-secret --from-literal user=demo-user --from-literal root_password=zT1KTgk
```

```
 oc set env deployment/demo --from secret/demo-secret --prefix MYSQL_
```
Secrets as Files in a Pod
```
oc set volume deployment/demo --add --type secret  --secret-name demo-secret  --mount-path /app-secrets 4

```

Expose the quotes service so that it can be accessed from outside the cluster.
```
oc expose service quotes  --hostname quotes.apps.ocp4.example.com
oc get route quotes

```
### Controlling Application Permissions with Security Context Constraints

Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
Red Hat OpenShift provides security context constraints (SCCs), a security mechanism that restricts access to resources, but not to operations in OpenShift.
OpenShift provides eight default SCCs:
anyuid
hostaccess
hostmount-anyuid
hostnetwork
node-exporter
nonroot
privileged
restricted

You can run the following command as a cluster administrator to list the SCCs defined by OpenShift:
```
oc get scc
```
To get additional information about an SCC, use the oc describe command:
```
oc describe scc anyuid
```
Use the scc-subject-review subcommand to list all the security context constraints that can overcome the limitations of a conta
```
oc get pod podname -o yaml | oc adm policy scc-subject-review -f -
```
Use the oc create serviceaccount command to create the service account, and use the -n option if the service account must be created in a namespace different than the current one:
```
oc create serviceaccount service-account-name
```
To associate the service account with an SCC, use the oc adm policy command. Use the -z option to identify a service account, and use the -n option if the service account exists in a namespace different than the current one:
```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user SCC -z service-account
```
Modify an existing deployment
```
 oc set serviceaccount deployment/deployment-name service-account-name
```
