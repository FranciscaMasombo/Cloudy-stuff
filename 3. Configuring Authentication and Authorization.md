### Configuring Authentication and Authorization
You should be able to configure the HTPasswd identity provider for OpenShift authentication.

### Describing OpenShift Users and Groups
Users in OpenShift are individual entities that represent the people or systems that interact with the cluster. They can be associated with individual accounts and can be assigned permissions to access resources in the cluster. Users can be created and managed using the OpenShift API or CLI, and they can be assigned to groups to simplify the process of granting permissions.

Groups in OpenShift are collections of users that are used to manage permissions. By assigning users to groups, administrators can manage access to resources in a flexible and scalable manner. For example, a group can be created for developers, and all members of the group can be granted permissions to deploy and manage applications. This makes it easy to manage permissions for large teams and to manage changes to permissions as the organization evolves.

Updating the OAuth Custom Resource
```
oc get oauth cluster -o yaml > oauth.yaml
```
Saving the file, you must apply the new custom resource using the oc replace command.
```
oc replace -f oauth.yaml
```

### Managing Users with the HTPasswd Identity Provider
Creating an HTPasswd File
```
htpasswd -c -B -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat123
```
Add or update credentials.
```
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat1234
Delete credentials.
```
Delete credentials.
```
htpasswd -D /tmp/htpasswd student
```
Creating the HTPasswd Secret
```
oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config
```
Extracting Secret Data
```
oc extract secret/htpasswd-secret -n openshift-config  --to /tmp/ --confirm /tmp/htpasswd
```
Updating the HTPasswd Secret
```
oc set data secret/htpasswd-secret --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config
```
Assigning Administrative Privileges
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin student
```
