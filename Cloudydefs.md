### What is a Container 
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers allow developers to deploy applications as self-contained systems, isolated from the environment, which can include the operating system, libraries, and system tools. The most common container technology is Docker.

### Whats is a Node
A node in a computer network or cluster is a device that has its own computing resources and can communicate with other nodes. In the context of container orchestration and cluster management, a node refers to a single machine or virtual machine that is part of a larger cluster. Nodes are used to run containers and host the various components of a container platform, such as the control plane, etcd, and worker services.

In OpenShift, a node is a worker machine that runs containers and provides computing resources for the applications. Nodes are managed by the OpenShift control plane and are used to host the containers and components of the applications that are deployed in the cluster. Nodes can be physical machines, virtual machines, or cloud instances, and they can be added or removed from the cluster as needed to scale the platform.

 ### What  is a worker machine 
 A worker machine is a computer in a cluster or network that is dedicated to running computational tasks, such as executing applications or processing data. In the context of container orchestration and cluster management, a worker machine is responsible for running containers and providing the computing resources needed by the applications.

In OpenShift, a worker machine is referred to as a node. Nodes run containers and provide the computing resources for the applications deployed in the OpenShift cluster. Nodes are managed by the OpenShift control plane, which ensures that the applications are deployed and running as expected. The control plane also monitors the health of the nodes and automatically reschedules containers to other nodes in the event of a node failure. Worker machines can be physical machines, virtual machines, or cloud instances, and they can be added or removed from the cluster as needed to scale the platform.

### What is a Pod
A pod in Kubernetes and OpenShift is a smallest and simplest unit in the deployment of an application. It is a logical host for one or more containers, which are deployed together on the same host and share the same network namespace. Pods provide a way to group containers that need to be deployed together, so that they can communicate with each other easily and share resources such as storage volumes and network IPs.

Each pod has its own IP address and can be accessed from other pods or from the network as a whole. Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, so they can communicate with each other using localhost. This makes it easy to deploy complex applications that are composed of multiple components, as each component can be packaged in a separate container and deployed within the same pod.

In OpenShift, pods are created and managed by the control plane, which ensures that the desired number of replicas are running and available. Pods can be created and managed using the OpenShift API or CLI, and they can be easily scaled up or down as needed to meet changing demands. Pods provide a flexible and scalable way to deploy applications in OpenShift, and they are a fundamental building block for deploying and managing modern, cloud-native applications.

### What is a namespace
A namespace in Kubernetes and OpenShift is a virtual partition or container that is used to organize resources within a cluster. It provides a way to separate resources and provide access control, enabling different parts of an organization to share a single cluster while keeping their resources isolated from one another.

Each namespace has its own unique name and can contain objects such as pods, services, and secrets. Objects within a namespace are isolated from objects in other namespaces, and access to the objects is controlled through role-based access control (RBAC) policies. This makes it easy to manage and secure the resources used by different parts of an organization, as well as to limit the blast radius of changes made to resources in one namespace.

In OpenShift, namespaces are used to organize and manage resources such as applications, services, and routes. They are created and managed using the OpenShift API or CLI, and they can be used to isolate resources and provide access control. Namespaces provide a flexible and scalable way to organize resources in OpenShift and make it easy to manage and secure large, complex applications and services.
