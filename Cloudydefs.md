what is a container 
```
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers allow developers to deploy applications as self-contained systems, isolated from the environment, which can include the operating system, libraries, and system tools. The most common container technology is Docker.
